Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice

I made an GIPHY page based off of dog breeds. 

Some code may be repetitive, and better put into a function, but my code worked and I didn't want to break it so I left it as is. I realize I call the API twice within my program. Once for a functionality when you click on a button, one for the functionality when you submit a new topic. I potentially could have made one API function to do all of this, but the query urls are different for each scenario, and it started to breakdown when I sperated he API call from the different query urls.
